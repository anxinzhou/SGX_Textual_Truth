For every node in the binary tree we first visit its left sub-tree (if its there) and then visit the parent node itself, and then the right sub-tree (if its there).
The inorder traversal of a binary tree visits the node of a binary tree in order according to their data values.
Traverses the binary tree in inorder. It lets you visit the nodes in order according to their data values.
Its used to visit nodes of a binary search tree in a search key order.
(Left side of tree) (Root) (Right side of tree)
printing a tree in order from least to greatest. This done by going as far left down the tree as possible and printing the parent and then right tree. Then move up the tree.
The in order is to go from left,root,right
Inorder traversal of a binary tree will retrieve start at the furthest left hand leaf and checks it, itâ€™s parent, and itâ€™s right side sibling, then it goes up a level and repeats until it gets to the root.
traverse the left subtree. visit the root. traverse the right subtree.
postorder
in order starts with the root then does right child then left child recursively
Left Child -&gt; Parent -&gt; Right Child
it goes from lowest to highest inside of the tree
starting by displaying the node furthest to the right, then the node, then the node on the right, in recursive order.
It travels left to right
void inorder(ptNode ptr)<br>{<br>if (ptr)<br>{<br>inorder (ptr-&gt;left);<br>cout&lt;&lt;ptr-&gt;data;<br>inorder(ptr-&gt;right);<br>}<br>}
the root is in the middle. The left subtree is traversed first, then the root, and finally the right subtree.
a traversal that visits the left branch first, then the parent node, then the right branch, recursively.
Inorder traversal visits the left branch of a node (all the way to it's deepest left-most leaf) before visiting the node itself. After visiting the entire left branch and the node, it visits the node's right branch following the same pattern of left child, node, right child.
left middle right
You traverse all the nodes to the left, then visit the root, then traverse all the nodes on the right.
you would go to the furthest down left most node, then to the root then to the right (if left and right exist) then you would return one node previous and do the same until you reached the root, then go to the furthest down left most node on the right side of the root and continue this process
it means that you traverse one subtree of a node, then look at the node itself before traversing the other subtree of the node
Level order traversal is a traversal method by which levels are visited successively starting with level 0 (the root node), and nodes are visited from left to right on each level, with Push and Pop methods.
