Just one per class.
As many as you want so long as they have different parameters.
There is no limit to the number of constructors in a class because like functions, constructors can be overloaded.
It depends what type of class is being defined. Typically you would have a constructor call for each object.
In C++, the constructor can be overloaded in that there can be more than one constructor for a class, each having different parameters.
1
any number you want
One
by default just one, but they may be overloaded to create as many constructors as necessary
as many as you want
As many as you want, with different parameters.
infinite
as many as you need
As many as are needed, depending on how many variables one wishes to directly modify or leave as default when instantiating an object.
A very large amount of constructors can be created for any given class through overloading. When two constructors with a different type or number of parameters are created, they are said to be overloaded, and C++ can recognize which constructor to use based on the type of the variables that are passed/returned.
It depends on the number of objects. Each object should have a constructor.
Theoretically unlimited, as long as they are defined by the programmer.
As many as needed.
as many as wanted/needed
several
One
one
There can be infinite constructors as long as the signature is different.
that depends on the number of data members in the class
one
you can overload constructors as you need
As many as the programmer wants to create.
one
as many as you want, as long as they each have a unique argument list
as many as the user decides to use.
