They are passed by reference because you want the function to change the pointer<br>
Linked lists are passed as arguments to a function by passing the head pointer of the list by reference.
- A function with access to a linked list's head pointer has access to the entire list.<br><br> - Pass the head ponter to a function as a reference argument.
By using a node.
Pass-by-reference

passes a pointer to a linked list object
The linked list object contains the head, through which the other elements are accessible.
By the head of the list. It takes the head address and traverses from there on in.

linked lists are passed by using pointers<br>
the head object is passed to the function
Linked lists permit insertion and removal of nodes at any point in the list in constant time,[1] but do not allow random access.
