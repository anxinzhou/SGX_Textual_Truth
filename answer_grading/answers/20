Both involve a controlled repetition structures, and they both have a termination test. Also both of them can loop forever.
As discussed earlier, recursion may be used to process iterative actions. Recursion is used for calculations where the answer can be described in a function that relates to itself.
Both iteration and recursion are based on control statements and involve repetition. They can both also occur indefinitely.

Iteration and recursion have many similarities: both are based on a control statement, involve repetition, involve a termination test, gradually approach termination and can occur infinitely.
Both rely on repetition, both have a base case, both can become an infinite loop. Anything recursive can also be solved with iteration.
Both will repeat (loop) until a condition is met, and exit the loop. Both are capable of entering an infinite loop.
anything you can do iterativly you can do recursively
Both are repetative and both have a end test.
Incorrectly writing either can result in infinite loops, both perform the same task over and over.

not answered
anything you can do recursively you can do iteratively
Many problems can be solved by both iteration and recursion, and either may go into a condition of infinite execution if a termination test is omitted.
Iteration and recursion both use repetition and perform several simple operations and algorithms successively until they reach a certain limit. So both involve a termination test to find that limit and both slowly approach that termination limit. Both are based on a control statement as well. <br><br>If coded poorly, both can continue on for forever until the compiler or the computer either locks up, shuts down or halts the operation.
both based on control statement, involve repetition, and involve a termination test within loops
they are methods of repeating the same task.
Both involve a termination test. <br>They use a control statement and repition to solve the problem. <br>They can also result in an infinite loop.
based on a control statement, involve repetition, involve a termination test.
Both are bases on a control statement. Both involve repetition. Both involve a termination test. Both gradually approach termination. Both can occur infinitely.
both based on a control statement, both involve repitition, both involve a termination test, both gradually approach termination, both can potentially occur infinetly.
they are both based on a control statement, both involve repetition, both involve a termination case, both graduatlly approach that termination case, and both can occur infinitely
They both use repetition, a control or test to terminate, and both can infinitely repeat if not defined correctly.
Both are based on a control statement; both gradually approach termination ending with a termination test; both involve repetition, and can both repeat infinitely if their termination requirements are not met.
both are based on a control statement, involve repetition and involve a termination test. both gradually approach termination, both can occur infinitely
they are used to solve the same type of problems. they do a task over and over again until a cirtain conditional statement is reached (its called the base case in recursion).
Based on control statement; involve repetition; involve a terminal test; both can occur infinitly<br>
repetition, termination test, eventually terminate, occur infinately
both need to have some kind of base case to tell when the loop needs to stop.
they both are able to do repetiive tasks. however recurisve calls itself with different parameters and defines and exit clause that is guaranteeed to be reached. Iterative includes a loop which iterates a pre-determined number of times, or checks for an exit clause every time through
